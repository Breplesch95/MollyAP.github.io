        <h1>Clients & Servers</h1>

        Computers connected 2 the internet r called clients & servers, here is how they interact:

        <img
            src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works/simple-client-server.png">

        <strong>Client</strong> - you & your internet-connected devices (computer, phone, fridge etc) but also the
        web-accessing software available on those
        devices ( Chrome, Firefox, Spotify etc).<br><br>

        <strong>Server</strong> - computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client wants 2 access a webpage,
        a copy of the webpage is downloaded from
        the server onto the client machine 2 be displayed in the user's web browser.<br><br>

        <strong>Internet connection</strong> - Allows you to send and receive data on the web<br><br>

        <strong>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol)</strong> - communication protocols that
        define how data should
        travel across the internet<br><br>

        <strong>DNS (Domain Name System)</strong> - is like an address book for websites. When you type a web address in
        your browser, the browser
        looks at the DNS to find the website's IP address before it can retrieve the website. The browser needs to find
        out which server the
        website lives on, so it can send HTTP messages to the right place<br><br>

        <strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</strong> - an application protocol that defines a language for
        clients and servers to speak to
        each other.<br><br>
        <strong>Component files</strong> - Websites consist of many different files, of which there are 2 main
        types:<br>
        <ul>
            <strong>Code files</strong> - Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript<br><br>

            <strong>Assets</strong> This is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes up a website, like
            images, music, video, Word
            documents, and PDFs.
        </ul>
        <h1>Connecting To Websites</h1>

        <ul>
            <ol>
                <li>The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address of the server that the website lives
                    on</li><br>

                <li>The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to
                    the
                    client, This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your
                    internet connection
                    using TCP/IP.</li><br>

                <li>If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, which
                    means
                    "Of course you can look at that website! Here it is", and then starts sending the website's files to
                    the
                    browser as a series of small chunks called data packets</li><br>

                <li>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to you</li><br>
            </ol >
        </ul >

                <h1>Parsing Order</h1>

                When browsers send requests to servers for HTML files, those HTML files often contain <mark>< link ></mark> elements referencing 
                external CSS stylesheets and <mark>< script ></mark> elements referencing external JavaScript scripts. Here is the order in which 
                those files are parsed by the browser while it loads the page:<br><br>

                    The browser parses the HTML file first, and that leads to the browser recognizing any <br><mark>< link ></mark> element references 
                    to external CSS stylesheets and any <mark>< script ></mark> element references to scripts.<br><br>

                    As the browser parses the HTML, it sends requests back to the server for any CSS files it has found from <mark>< link ></mark> 
                    elements, and any JavaScript files it has found from <mark>< script ></mark> elements, and from those, then parses the CSS and 
                    JavaScript.<br><br>

                    The browser generates an in memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, generates an in memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS, 
                    and compiles and executes the parsed JavaScript.<br><br>

                    As the browser builds the DOM tree and applies the styles from the CSSOM tree and executes the JavaScript, a visual 
                    representation of the page is painted to the screen, and the user sees the page content and can begin to interact with it.<br><br>

                <h1>Structure Of A HTML Document</h1>

                <strong>Header</strong> - A big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and tagline, usually stays the same from one 
                webpage to another.<br><br>

                <strong>Navigation Bar</strong> - Links 2 the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs, Like the header 
                    it's usually consistent across pages, inconsistencies here will lead to confused, frustrated users, many web designers 
                    consider it part of the header, not an individual component, but that's not a requirement in fact, some also argue that it's 
                    better for accessibility to have them seperate because screen readers can read them better<br><br>
                
                <strong>Main Content</strong> - A big area in the center that contains most of the content of the webpage, 
                (video, a story, a map, or a news article, etc) this part of the website inherently varies from page to page<br><br>
                    
                <strong>Sidebar</strong> - Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc Usually, this is contextual to what is contained in the 
                main content (for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, or links to related articles) but 
                there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements like a secondary navigation system<br><br>
                
                <strong>Footer</strong> - A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact 
                info, It's a place to put common information (like the header) but usually, that information is not critical or secondary to the 
                website itself. The footer is also sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing links for quick access to popular content.<br><br>
