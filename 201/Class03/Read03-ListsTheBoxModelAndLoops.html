        <h1>HTML: HyperText Markup Language</h1> 
        
        HTML is the most basic building block of the internet, it defines the meaning and structure of the content on it, there are other 
        technologies too, like css which describes a web page's appearance/presentation and JavaScript which describes it's functionality/behavior<br><br>

        The "Hypertext" in HTML refers to links that connect web pages, either within a single website or between websites, links are a fundamental
         aspect of the Webwhen you upload content to the Internet and link it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant 
         in the World Wide Web

         The "markup" in HTML refers to it annotating text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special 
         "elements" such as:<br><br>

         <div class="box">
        <strong>< head ></strong> - container for metadata (data about the HTML document), and thus is not displayed, typically defines the documents title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information<br><br>
        <strong>< title ></strong> - text-only element that defines the title of the document, and is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab (very important for search engine optimization aka SEO)<br><br>
        <strong>< body ></strong> - defines the document's body, consequently containing all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.<br><br>
        <strong>< header ></strong> - container for introductory content or a set of navigational links typically containing one or more heading elements (< h1 > - < h6 >), logo/icon, or authorship information<br><br>
        <strong>< footer ></strong> - defines the bottom of a web page/section, usualy containing copyright info, navigation links, contact details, etc, but in the case of the last one, put it in the "< address >" tag<br><br>
        <strong>< article ></strong> - independent, self-contained content that should make sense on its own and be possible to distribute independently from the rest of the site.<br><br>
        <strong>< section ></strong> - standalone sections on a page with logically connected content (news block, contact information), often used when creating a landing page to divide it into separate logical blocks.<br><br>
        <strong>< p ></strong> - defines a paragraph, always starts on a new line and browsers automatically add a margin before and after each one, but if you just need to move text to a new line use the <br>"< br >" tag<br><br>
        <strong>< div ></strong> -  <br><br>
        <strong>< span ></strong> -  <br><br>
        <strong>< img ></strong> -  <br><br>
        <strong>< aside ></strong> -  <br><br>
        <strong>< audio ></strong> -  <br><br>
        <strong>< canvas ></strong> -  <br><br>
        <strong>< datalist ></strong> -  <br><br>
        <strong>< details ></strong> -  <br><br>
        <strong>< embed ></strong> -  <br><br>
        <strong>< nav ></strong> -  <br><br>
        <strong>< output ></strong> -  <br><br>
        <strong>< progress ></strong> -  <br><br>
        <strong>< video ></strong> -  <br><br>
        <strong>< ul ></strong> -  <br><br>
        <strong>< ol ></strong> -  <br><br>
        <strong>< li ></strong> -  <br><br>
         </div>

        and many others.

An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.
