        <h1>Control Flow</h1> 
        
        control flow - order that computer executes statements in a script<br><br>

        code runs in sequental order from the 1st line 2 the last line, unless there  
        r conditionals, loops, or othr structures that change the control flow
        if u have a script that validates user data from a webpage and the user 
        leaves a required field empty the script should prompt them 2 fill it in. 
        2 do this, u use a conditional structure or <mark>if...else</mark>, so different 
        code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not

        <xmp>
            if (isEmpty(field)) {
                promptUser();
              } else {
                submitForm();
              }
        </xmp>

        typical JavaScript, PHP, etc include lots of control structures like 
        conditionals, loops, & functions, parts of a script can also be set to 
        execute only when certain events occur.<br><br>

        the above code could b inside a function that only runs when the user clicks the 
        Submit button, it could also include a loop, which iterates through all of 
        the fields in the form, checking each one, looking back at the code in the <mark>if</mark> 
        & <mark>else</mark> sections, the lines <mark>promptUser</mark> and <mark>submitForm</mark> could also call to 
        other functions in the script, control structures can dictate complex flows 
        of processing even with only a few lines of code.<br><br>

        with this in mind when reading scripts look at the program structure and how 
        it affects the order of execution, not just from start to finish<br><br>
