Welcome to my page, I'm a 24 year old that lives in Millington, Tennessee. While I am in coding classes art is my real passion which explains why I'm so enamored with the graphic design aspect of this work, my philosophy is "if it isn't pretty I don't want to be apart of it" but in practice it's more like "if it isn't pretty I will obssess about it and give myself a headache until it is" much to my chagrin. I have a <a href="https://github.com/MollyAP">github</a> so feel free to to visit and take a look at my code! <br> Phone: (901) 466-6590 <br> Email: mollyporphura@gmail.com</p></div>
