        Hi I'm Molly! Welcome to my page, I'm a 24 year old that lives in Millington, Tennessee. While I am in coding
        classes art is my
        real passion which explains why I'm so enamored with the graphic design aspect of this work, my philosophy is
        "if it isn't pretty I don't
        want to be apart of it" but in practice it's more like "if it isn't pretty I will obssess about it and give
        myself a headache until it is"
        much to my chagrin. I have a <a href="https://github.com/MollyAP">github</a> so feel free to to visit and take a
        look at my code!<br><br>
